You are given a multiple-choice question with options extracted via OCR. These options may contain formatting or syntax errors, such as:
- Missing dots (e.g. 'dfwrite' instead of 'df.write')
- Incorrect or mismatched quotation marks (e.g. " or ')
- Broken syntax (e.g. misplaced commas)

Your task is to:
1. Fix all syntax and formatting issues in the code options.
2. Return a clean, corrected version of the question and options.

Use this exact output format:

Question <number>: <cleaned question>

Options:
1. <corrected option>
2. <corrected option>
3. <corrected option>
4. <corrected option>

Only return the corrected version. Do not include the original OCR version.
